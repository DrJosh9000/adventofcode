My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions.

I try to write these as quickly as possible, and each solution needs to work for
exactly one (1) input file. Good code this is not. *Do not* read the code here
or seek inspiration in this repo, particularly for

* readability / maintainable code,
* correctness,
* scalability,
* good uses of language or library features,
* or even efficiency.

You have been warned!

## Hints
